# .NET_AzureWebAppLab

### Lab Scenario
In this lab, you will deploy and configure an Azure Web App that integrates with GitHub. The web app will be a simple implementation of a single-page web app accessible only to internal employees. The website will host content related to company strategies and division sales goals.

To create the web app, you will use the Azure portal and connect it to a GitHub repository. To do this, you will need a free GitHub account, where you will upload the sample website content provided as part of this lab. Once the web app is up and running, you will make changes to the content and watch as the GitHub content is synced to the web app, using the CI/CD methodology.

Because this is an employee-only web app, you will need to secure access to the web app by creating users in Azure AD and implementing security for the web app through user authentication.
